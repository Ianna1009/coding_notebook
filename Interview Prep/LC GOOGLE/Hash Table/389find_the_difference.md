## 389.Find the Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

**Example:**

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

**Solution \#1: \(Hash table\)**

```
def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
    cont_s = collections.Counter(s)
    for i in t:
        if i not in cont_s:
            return i
        cont_s[i] -= 1
        if cont_s[i] < 0:
            return i
    return None
```

**Solution \#2: \(Bit\)**

```
class Solution(object):
    def findTheDifference(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        res = 0
        for c in s:
            res ^= ord(c)
        for c in t:
            res ^= ord(c)
        return chr(res)
```

**Notes:**

In the Bit solution,  ^ can't be used between two unicodes, or strings directly in Python, so:

 unicode -> bin**, use `ord`

 bin - unicode, use `chr`
