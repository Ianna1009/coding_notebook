## 139. Word Break
Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

    For example, given
    s = "leetcode",
    dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

** Analysis: **

dp[i] stands for whether you can insert a space at i such that from 0 to i, there are at least one available word in the dictionary.

**Solution:**

    class Solution(object):
        def wordBreak(self, s, wordDict):
            """
            :type s: str
            :type wordDict: Set[str]
            :rtype: bool
            """
            dp = [False] * (len(s)+1)
            dp[0] = True
            for i in xrange(1, len(s)+1):
                for k in xrange(i):
                    if dp[k] == True and s[k:i] in wordDict:
                        dp[i] = True
            return dp[-1]
