## (Yahoo)142. Linked List Cycle II

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

**Note: **
Similar as it is with version I. Fast and slow pointers gonna be used here.

The main part here is how to find the entrance of the cycle in the linked list:


** Use the fact that fast pointer will be travel twice faster than the slow pointer. ** Therefore, eventually when fast pointer traveled twice through the list, slow one should travel only once in total.

** Solution: **


    class Solution(object):
        def detectCycle(self, head):
            """
            :type head: ListNode
            :rtype: ListNode
            """
            if head is None or head.next is None:
                return None

            slow = head
            fast = head
            while fast != None and fast.next != None:
                slow = slow.next
                fast = fast.next.next
                if slow == fast:
                    fast = head
                    while slow != fast:
                        slow = slow.next
                        fast = fast.next
                    return slow
            return None
