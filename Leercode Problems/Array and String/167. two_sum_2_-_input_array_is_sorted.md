## 167. Two Sum 2 - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already ***sorted in ascending order***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
    Output: index1=1, index2=2

** Solution: **

Use the property that the array is sorted, we can do better with two-pointer:

    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        slow = 0
        fast = len(numbers) - 1
        while slow < fast:
            sum = numbers[slow] + numbers[fast]
            if sum == target:
                return [slow+1, fast+1]
            elif sum < target:
                slow += 1
            else:
                fast -= 1
        return [-1, -1]
            

** Conclusion:**
1. Trade-offs betwen brute force or hash table:
    
|       |Brute Force|Hash Table|Two Pointer|
| - | - | - | - |
| Time  |   O(n^2)  |    O(n)   |   O(n)   |
| Space |   O(1)    |    O(n)   |   O(1)   |
**2. Important Notes: **
   1. Two-pointer always condition on: ``slow < fast``
   2. Be careful with the return condition `` sum == target``, if there is no one, eventually will be no solution, i.e. ``return [-1, -1]``.
