## Detection Cycle in an Undirected Graph

Given an undirected graph, how to check if there is a cycle in the graph? For example, the following graph has a cycle 1-0-2-1.

    1 -- 0 -- 3
    |   /     |
    |  /      |
     2        4

Like directed graphs, we can use DFS to detect cycle in an undirected graph in O(V+E) time. 

We do a DFS traversal of the given graph. For every visited vertex `v`, if there is an adjacent `u` such that `u` is already visited and `u` is not parent of `v`, then there is a cycle in graph. If we donâ€™t find such an adjacent for any vertex, we say that there is no cycle. The assumption of this approach is that there are no parallel edges between any two vertices.

**Application:**
1. Check if an undirected graph is a valid tree.
2. Topological sort.

**Algorithm:**

        # A recursive function that uses visited[] and parent to detect
        # cycle in subgraph reachable from vertex v.
        def isCyclicUtil(self,v,visited,parent):

            #Mark the current node as visited 
            visited[v]= True

            #Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
            for i in self.graph[v]:
                # If the node is not visited then recurse on it
                if  visited[i]==False : 
                    if(self.isCyclicUtil(i,visited,v)):
                        return True
                # If an adjacent vertex is visited and not parent of current vertex,
                # then there is a cycle
                elif  parent!=i:
                    return True

            return False


        #Returns true if the graph contains a cycle, else false.
        def isCyclic(self):
            # Mark all the vertices as not visited
            visited =[False]*(self.V)
            # Call the recursive helper function to detect cycle in different
            #DFS trees
            for i in range(self.V):
                if visited[i] ==False: #Don't recur for u if it is already visited
                    if(self.isCyclicUtil(i,visited,-1))== True:
                        return True

            return False
