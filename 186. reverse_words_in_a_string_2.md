## 186. Reverse words in a string 2
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces and the words are always separated by a single space.

    For example,
    Given s = "the sky is blue",
    return "blue is sky the".

**Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?**

** Solution_1 Using Reverse:**

    class Solution(object):
        def reverseWords(self, s):
            """
            :type s: a list of 1 length strings (List[str])
            :rtype: nothing
            """
            s.reverse()
            k = 0
            for i in xrange(len(s)+1):
                if i == len(s) or s[i] == " ":
                    s[i-k:i] = reversed(s[i-k:i])
                    k = 0
                else:
                    k += 1
                
 ** Conclusion: **
 1. Time Complexity:O(N) and Space Complexity: O(1)?
 2. Reverse the whole string: s.reverse()
 3. Reverse part of the string i~j-1: s[i:j] = reversed(s[i:j])
