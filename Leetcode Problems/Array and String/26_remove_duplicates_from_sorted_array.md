## 26.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

```
For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2].
Return 2.
```
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.


**Solution \(Two-pointer\):**

Since the array is **already sorted**, we can keep two pointers `i` and `j`, where `i` is the slow-runner while `j` is the fast-runner. As long as `nums[i] = nums[j]`, we increment `j` to skip the duplicate.

When we encounter `nums[j] ≠ nums[i]`, the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to `nums[i+1]`. `i` is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until `j` reaches the end of array.

```
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    i = 0
    for j in xrange(1, n):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i+1
```

** Conclusion: **  
1. Time Complexity O\(N\) and Space Complexity O\(1\)
