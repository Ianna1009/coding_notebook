## 111. Minimum Depth of binary tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

** Note: every recursion is a sub-case of the previous one. **

**Solution: **

    class Solution(object):
        def minDepth(self, root):
            """
            :type root: TreeNode
            :rtype: int
            """
            
            # Edge Case: [], if not adding it here, then input:[] -> output:inf
            if root is None:
                return 0
                
            return self.helper(root)

        def helper(self, node):
        
            # Edge case: [1, 2], right leaf is empty, then it'll return 0, but it's not a valid min length (root -> leaf)
            if node == None:
                return float('inf')
                
            # must be a leaf
            if node.left == None and node.right == None:
                return 1
                
            return min(self.helper(node.left), self.helper(node.right)) + 1


** Note: **

One condition needs to be clear:

In the helper function, the 2nd condition `` if node,left == None and node.right == None`` makes sure the traversal stops at the leaf, node is the current left, then we add one.
    
If current node is a leaf, we return. With this condition, `` if node == None`` that's saying current node is not a leaf, in other words it's parent has the other child-node. That makes this node no contribution to min-depth. Thus we return an impossible answer: INFINITY.
