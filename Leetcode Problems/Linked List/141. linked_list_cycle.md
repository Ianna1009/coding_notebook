**Solution: **

    class Solution(object):
        def hasCycle(self, head):
            """
            :type head: ListNode
            :rtype: bool
            """
            if head is None:
                return False
            fast = head.next
            slow = head
            while fast != slow:
                if fast == None or fast.next == None:
                    return False
                else:
                    fast = fast.next.next
                    slow = slow.next
            return True
