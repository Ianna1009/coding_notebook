## 151. Reverse words in a string

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

    For example,
    Given s = "the sky is blue",
    return "blue is sky the".

Update (2015-02-12):
    For C programmers: Try to solve it in-place in O(1) space.

**Clarification**:
1. What constitutes a word?
    A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
2. Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
    Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
3. How about multiple spaces between two words?
    Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
    
**Here are my solution in python:**

    class Solution(object):
        def reverseWords(self, s):
            """
            :type s: str
            :rtype: str
            """
            return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])
            
** Conclusion:** 
1. Time Complexity: O(N) and Space Complexity O(N)
    1. s.split(): traverse the whole list with O(N)
    2. s[::-1] and s.reverse() with O(N)
    3. " ".join(): O(N)
2. list of words converts to string with spaces between words:
      Needs to think about " ".join(list).
3. ** How about Using only O(1) space? **
  
** Follow up with O(1) space:**
