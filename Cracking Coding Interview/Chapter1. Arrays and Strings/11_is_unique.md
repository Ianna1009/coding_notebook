## 1.1 Is Unique

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

1. Using a boolean array with size 128 if ASCII string was used (Unicode would be 256)
2. Using a hashset (O(n) but O(n) space)
3. Using two-pointer (O(n^2))
4. Using sort (O(nlgn))
